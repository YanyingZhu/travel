Although there are many interesting legends and stories explaining the start of the Chinese New Year festival, the main two reasons for the festival are:<br>To celebrate a year of hard work, have a good rest, and relax with family<br>To wish for a lucky and prosperous coming year<br>Chinese people believe that a good start to the year will lead to a lucky year. Chinese traditionally celebrated the start of a new year of farm work, and wished for a good harvest (when most were farmers). This has now evolved to celebrating the start of a new business year and wishing for profits and success in various vocations.</p>
